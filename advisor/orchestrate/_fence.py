    A literal backtick closes the span early and leaks following text as
    instruction prose; an embedded newline collapses the surrounding
    sentence and can dump user-controlled content onto its own line where
    another ``{placeholder}`` might be reinterpreted. Swap backticks for
    typographic single quotes, then route through :func:`_strip_linebreaks`
    for the full canonical line-break / zero-width strip.
