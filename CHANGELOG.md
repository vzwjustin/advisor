## [Unreleased]

### Added — context-pressure knobs on the CLI
- `advisor plan --max-fixes-per-runner N` (and `pipeline`, `prompt`, `ui`):
  lower the hard cap on sequential fixes per runner when runners are
  exhausting context mid-fix-wave. Default remains `5`; the knob was
  previously only reachable by constructing a `TeamConfig` in Python.
- `advisor plan --large-file-line-threshold N` / `--large-file-max-fixes M`:
  tune the tighter fix cap that kicks in for batches containing any file
  at/above the threshold. Defaults remain `800` lines / `3` fixes.
- Checkpoints now persist `large_file_line_threshold` and
  `large_file_max_fixes`, so `advisor plan --resume` reproduces the
  capped-run configuration instead of silently using the live defaults.
  Legacy checkpoints (pre-upgrade) load cleanly with the documented
  defaults.

### Changed — runner prompt gives runners sharper self-awareness
- `build_runner_pool_prompt` now tells each runner, explicitly, that it
  has no direct read on its remaining context window (no tool exposes it
  to subagents, and subjective "I feel foggy" signals are unreliable)
  and to track two concrete proxies instead:
  - **Fix-count proxy (primary):** ping `CONTEXT_PRESSURE` after fix
    `(N-1)` of `max_fixes_per_runner` — *before* accepting the next
    assignment — so the advisor has one fix of runway to spawn the
    successor runner and build a handoff brief. Previously runners were
    told to ping "as they approach the cap", which in practice meant at
    the cap, which is too late.
  - **Read-count proxy (secondary):** if the runner has Read more than
    ~15 files in its session (explore + fixes combined), flag at-risk at
    the start of the next assignment. Catches heavy-cross-reference
    sessions that exhaust context before the fix count catches up.
  - Subjective symptoms (slower replies, hazy recall) are demoted to a
    backup-only signal.
- Advisor prompt mirror-updated: the strategist is now told to keep an
  explicit mental ledger of per-runner fix counts and to treat the
  early `CONTEXT_PRESSURE` ping as the normal rotation trigger, not an
  exception.

### Fixed
- `advisor --print-completion` error hint now points at the correct PyPI
  distribution name (`advisor-agent[completion]`) instead of the non-existent
  `advisor[completion]`, so users who copy-paste the suggested install command
  don't hit "No matching distribution found"
- `advisor doctor` now surfaces `ADVISOR_NO_NUDGE` in its `env_overrides`
  report (previously it tracked a phantom `ADVISOR_NO_AUTO_INSTALL` that is
  not read anywhere in the codebase)
- `advisor protocol` reference now matches the current defaults
  (`TeamCreate(name="review")`, `model="opus"` / `model="sonnet"`) instead of
  the stale `advisor-review` / `opus-4` / `sonnet-4` strings that would no
  longer work if pasted verbatim
- Advisor prompt template now threads `TeamConfig.team_name` through to the
  runner-identity briefing line; runners invoked under a custom `--team` no
  longer get told they are on `team review`
- `advisor plan --resume --estimate` now uses the checkpoint's recorded
  models / `test_command` when computing the cost estimate, instead of
  silently falling back to whatever CLI defaults the resuming invocation
  happens to have
- `advisor history --limit` now rejects zero / negative integers via
  argparse (was previously accepted and produced surprising slice results
  because `entries[-(-N):]` is not "last N")
- Dashboard JS no longer sends a dead `target` query param to `/api/plan`
  and `/api/cost` — the server has always ignored it (target is fixed when
  the server starts) and shipping it just hinted at multi-root support
  that does not exist

### Added — E1–E12 enhancement pack
- **E1 — Git-incremental scoping**: `advisor plan --since REF`, `--staged`,
  `--branch BASE` to scope reviews to changed files only. Turns advisor
  into a PR-review tool.
- **E2 — Language-aware priority keywords**: `rank.py` now ships Python,
  JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Rust keyword sets. Per-file language is
  auto-detected from extension and contributes to P1–P5 scoring alongside
  the cross-language baseline.
- **E3 — Cost / time estimates**: `advisor plan --estimate` prints
  per-run token and USD estimates based on file size + prompt overhead +
  runner fix count. `CostEstimate` and `estimate_cost()` are public API.
- **E4 — `advisor doctor` diagnostic**: health-checks Python, `git`,
  `claude` CLI, `~/.claude` integrity, install status (with version skew
  detection via the new badge), and active `ADVISOR_*` env overrides.
- **E5 — Env-var defaults**: `ADVISOR_MODEL`, `ADVISOR_RUNNER_MODEL`,
  `ADVISOR_MAX_RUNNERS`, `ADVISOR_FILE_TYPES`, `ADVISOR_MIN_PRIORITY`,
  `ADVISOR_TEST_COMMAND` — set once in shell profile / CI env for
  org-wide defaults.
- **E6 — JSON schema versioning**: `"schema_version": "1.0"` on every
  JSON output (`status`, `plan`, `install --check`, `doctor`, `history`)
  so downstream parsers can switch on it.
- **E7 — `plan --output FILE`**: dump JSON plan to a file for CI
  artifact archiving.
- **E8 — Test orchestration**: `TeamConfig.test_command` (+ CLI
  `--test-cmd "pytest -q"`) threads a test command into the advisor
  prompt so runners can loop on failures.
- **E9 — Findings history**: `.advisor/history.jsonl` is appended after
  each confirmed finding. Advisor prompt auto-injects the last N entries
  so recurring issues surface across runs. `advisor history` prints
  (or JSONs) the log.
- **E10 — Model-name validation**: `TeamConfig` warns once on unknown
  `advisor_model` / `runner_model` names (whitelist: `opus`/`sonnet`/
  `haiku` + long-form `claude-*`). Typos get flagged early.
- **E11 — Per-run checkpoint**: `advisor plan --checkpoint` writes
  `.advisor/run-<ts>.json` containing the rank + dispatch plan +
  rendered advisor prompt. `advisor plan --resume <ts>` reconstructs
  the plan without rescanning. Survives Claude Code session crashes.
- **E12 — CLAUDE.md version badge**: SKILL.md now carries a
  `<!-- advisor:X.Y.Z -->` badge. `status --json` surfaces
  `skill.installed_version`; `doctor` shows version-skew messages like
  "installed: 0.3.0, available: 0.4.0 — run: advisor install".

### Fixes / polish
- `InstallAction` is now exported from `advisor` top-level (was used
  internally and documented but not actually importable — fixed)
- `make release-check` — full pre-release gate (clean + lint + mypy +
  tests + wheel build + version/changelog sanity print)
- `make release` — prints the exact tag-and-push sequence after gate
- `test_all_symbols_in_all_resolve` — meta-test preventing future
  public-API drift
- `advisor.__version__` attribute (populated from installed package
  metadata)
- `mypy` now runs as part of `pre-commit` (previously CI-only)
- `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly dev-dep updates
- Tag-triggered release workflow (PyPI trusted publishing)
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue/PR templates
- Hypothesis `@settings(deadline=1000)` on fuzz tests to prevent
  Windows CI flakes

### Coverage
- Test count: 164 → **348** (+112%)
- Overall coverage: unmeasurable → **88%**
- `__main__.py` coverage: 68% → **74%** (new CLI surfaces tested)
- New module coverage: `checkpoint.py` 100%, `cost.py` 98%,
  `history.py` 94%, `doctor.py` 83%, `git_scope.py` 83%

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Breaking
- Removed deprecated APIs: `build_explore_prompt`, `build_explore_agent`, `build_rank_agent`
  (use `build_advisor_prompt` + `build_runner_pool_prompt` instead)
- `advisor.orchestrate` is now a package (submodules: `config`, `advisor_prompt`,
  `runner_prompts`, `verify_dispatch`, `pipeline`). All public symbols remain
  importable from `advisor` and `advisor.orchestrate`.

### Added
- `InstallAction` string enum (`INSTALLED`/`UPDATED`/`UNCHANGED`/`REMOVED`/`ABSENT`/`SKIPPED`)
  replaces the bare-string action field on `InstallResult`. String equality still holds.
- `--json` output on `advisor status`, `advisor plan`, and `advisor install --check`
- `--quiet` flag on `install`/`uninstall` for CI use
- `--strict` flag on `advisor status` (exits `3` when anything is missing/outdated)
- `target` positional now defaults to `.` (current directory) for every subcommand
- `--context -` reads stdin so large scope descriptions can be piped in
- `.advisorignore`: `**` recursive globs now work via `PurePath.match`
- `verify.parse_findings_from_text` now only skips `### Finding` section headers
  (previously any line starting with `#` was dropped, mangling markdown bodies)
- CI workflow for Python 3.10–3.13 on Linux and Windows (ruff + mypy + pytest)
- `[project.optional-dependencies]` for `dev` and `test` extras
- Explicit `[tool.ruff]` / `[tool.mypy]` config in `pyproject.toml`
- Bash/zsh completion via `shtab` (`advisor --print-completion bash|zsh`)
- `advisor protocol` subcommand — prints the strict team-lifecycle sequence
  (`TeamCreate` → spawn advisor → runner pool → shutdowns → `TeamDelete`)
  as an ad-hoc reference without the full pipeline body
- Hypothesis fuzz test for `parse_findings_from_text` (100+ adversarial inputs)

### Fixed
- `_read_head` now uses `CONTENT_SCAN_LIMIT` (was reading 2× the scanned budget)
- `_safe_rglob` also catches `OSError` (symlink loops, permission errors)
- `_atomic_write_text` writes with mode `0o644` so editors/tools can read it
  (previously inherited `tempfile.mkstemp`'s `0o600`) and uses a randomized
  tmp name to avoid predictable-suffix TOCTOU on shared hosts
- `build_runner_dispatch_messages` now raises `ValueError` on empty `batch.tasks`
- `~50×` faster keyword scoring via a single combined regex (one `finditer` pass
  replaces ~50 `pattern.search` calls per file)
- Removed internal `rtk` CLI reference that leaked into the shipped CLAUDE.md nudge
- `create_focus_tasks` now substitutes `{file_path}` / `{priority}` / `{reasons}`
  in a **single pass** — a path containing a literal `{reasons}` token is no
  longer rewritten by the later substitution (order-dependence bug in the old
  `.replace()` chain)
- `build_advisor_prompt` body extracted to `advisor/orchestrate/_prompts/advisor.txt`
  so the 220-line strategist prompt is diffable as prose; the Python builder is
  now ~70 lines of placeholder wiring
- `colorize_markdown` — consolidated 3 per-depth header regexes (`_H2`/`_H3`/`_H4`)
  into one `_HEADER_RE` (7 → 5 passes); depth determines style
- `ensure_nudge` write failures now render as a yellow `⚠ warn` line (was
  invisible dim text) AND surface on `InstallResult.error` so programmatic
  consumers can detect partial installs
- `advisor --help` for `--file-types`: clarified that `*.py` already recurses via
  `rglob`; users must NOT pass `**/*.py`
- `uv.lock` regenerated — now reflects full dev dependency graph (was 134 bytes)

### Testing
- Parametrized tests over `PRIORITY_KEYWORDS` to lock in tier assignments
- Direct coverage for `cmd_install`/`cmd_uninstall`, `_safe_rglob`, `_config_from_args`
- Replaced bare `try/except` idioms with `pytest.raises(...)` for clarity
- Round-trip test: `format_findings_block → parse_findings_from_text` is identity
- Regression test for the `{file_path}`/`{reasons}` ordering bug in `create_focus_tasks`
- Header-depth parametrized tests for the consolidated `colorize_markdown` H2/H3/H4 pass
- `ensure_nudge` error-surfacing tests (result.error populated, warning is visible)
- `advisor protocol` subcommand coverage (lifecycle steps printed, no nudge side-effect)

### Hardening (follow-up)
- `_atomic_write_text` now **refuses to write through a symlink target** and
  opens the parent directory with `O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY` (where available)
  to defend against swap-dir TOCTOU on shared hosts
- `supports_color()` is now **cached with env auto-invalidation** — every
  styled span previously re-read two env vars; the cache transparently
  notices `NO_COLOR`/`TERM` changes and the autouse `conftest.py` fixture
  invalidates between tests so `monkeypatch.setenv` still works
- `colorize_markdown` priority regex consolidated: `**P3**` (bold) and bare
  `P3` now match in a single alternation pass (5 → 4 regex scans total)
- `mypy strict = true` enabled; all 15 source modules type-check clean
- Prompt-engineering rationale documented in `docs/prompts.md` (why `.txt`
  extraction, why the fenced-goal idiom, why pre-finding verification is
  mandatory, etc.)
- Module-dependency graph and runtime flow documented in `docs/architecture.md`
